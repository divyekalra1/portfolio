        Hey! I am Divye Kalra, a graduate cybersecurity student from Johns Hopkins University, Homewood Campus. Broadly, my research interests include cryptography, network and distributed systems security. <br> 
        I am currently working as a Vehicle Security Researcher at Johns Hopkins University and the Applied Physics Laboratory, under the supervision of <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/anton-dahbura/">Dr. Anton Dahbura</a>, <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/krishan-sabnani/">Dr. Krishan Sabnani</a>, and Dr. Ilya Sabnani. My work focuses on cybersecurity and assurance challenges in connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), including integrating C-V2X communication into VESNOS to strengthen the Secure Credential Management System (SCMS) and reduce communication latency.
        Previously, I was a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://trustlab.iitb.ac.in/">IITB Trust Lab</a>, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mp/">Prof. Manoj Prabhakaran</a>, where I worked on implementing CASE (Completely Anonymous Signed Encryption) in Rust and contributed to ECAS optimizations. Before that, I conducted research at the Cyber Security Hub, Macquarie University, under <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/dali-kaafar">Dr. Dali Kaafar</a>, focusing on secure multi-party computation using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), privacy-preserving query systems, record linkage, and cryptographic system design. Published work can be found <a href="/portfolio/publications">here</a>.
