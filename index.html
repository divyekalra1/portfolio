        Hey! I am Divye Kalra, a final-year undergraduate student from Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) Pilani, Hyderabad
        Campus, India. <br><br>
        Currently, I am working at the <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/partner/access-business-opportunities/innovation-entrepreneurship-and-it/cyber-security-hub">Macquarie University Cyber Security Hub</a>, Australia as a visiting researcher, working on a thesis involving
        secure multi-party computation (SMPC) with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). <br><br>
        Broadly, my research interests include cryptography, cloud and hardware security! <br>In the past, I have worked in areas like data encryption, design and implementation of stream ciphers and machine-learning based prediction algorithms under the guidance of <a href="https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/manishkumar/Profile">Dr. Manish Kumar</a> and <a href="https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Hyderabad/bhattacharjee/Profile">Dr. Ankur Bhattacharjee</a>.
