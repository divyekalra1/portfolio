    I am a fifth-year undergraduate student from Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) Pilani, Hyderabad
    Campus, India. <br><br>
    Currently, I am working @ Macquarie University, Australia as a visiting researcher, working on a thesis involving
    secure multi-party computation (SMPC) with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). <br><br>
    Broadly, my research interests include cryptography, cloud and hardware security! I have worked in areas like data encryption, design and implementation of stream ciphers and machine-learning based prediction under the guidance of <a href="https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/manishkumar/Profile">Dr. Manish Kumar</a> and <a href="https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Hyderabad/bhattacharjee/Profile">Dr. Ankur Bhattacharjee</a>.
