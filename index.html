        Hey! I am Divye Kalra, a first-year MSSI student from Johns Hopkins University, Homewood Campus. Broadly, my research interests include cryptography, network and distributed systems security. <br> 
        In the past, I have worked at the <a href="https://trustlab.iitb.ac.in/">IITB Trust Lab</a>, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, as a visiting researcher under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mp/">Prof. Manoj Prabhakaran</a> on a project involving the implementation of a COA-secure cryptographic primitive called CASE.
        I have also worked in areas like secure multi-party computation with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), record linkage, and the design and implementation of stream ciphers and machine-learning based prediction algorithms under the guidance of <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/dali-kaafar">Dr. Dali Kaafar</a>, <a href="https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/manishkumar/Profile">Dr. Manish Kumar</a> and <a href="https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Hyderabad/bhattacharjee/Profile">Dr. Ankur Bhattacharjee</a>. Published work can be found <a href="/portfolio/publications">here</a>.
